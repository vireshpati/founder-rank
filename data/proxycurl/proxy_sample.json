I've founded companies, raised money, and built teams. I've also managed philanthropic grant programs, connected scientists with funders, and mapped nascent scientific fields. I currently work primarily in aerospace and climate tech.\n\nOn the engineering side, I have experience architecting software systems, hiring and mentoring engineers, managing teams, maintaining open source packages, running security programs, developing articulate APIs, prioritizing product and technical roadmaps, optimizing the performance of complex codebases, cajoling LLMs, integrating numerical machine learning systems... and generally just writing a lot of code. I created Huginn, an open source application for web automation, and a number of other open source packages (https://github.com/cantino).\n\nWhen I'm not building things, I think about scientific progress, climate, and the space industry (https://orbitalindex.com).\n\nTo contact me or learn more about my interests, please visit: https://andrewcantino.com",
